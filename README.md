# JumpThing

Just an experiment on making tight controls on a 3d platformer, my inpirations are Overgrowth, various open world super-hero-ishy games â€‹like Spider-man or Prototype.

I'm also experimenting with cloud rendering, since I want to make a Skyward Sword style world with floating islands and a sea of clouds below.

Still in very early and very slow development
